This repo will hold all of the files for my zillow project. The purpose of this project is to practice the data science pipeline by filtering and acquiring data using SQL, cleaning data using Pandas, splitting, scaling, and modeling data using functions I created to make my work reproducible. 

The goals for my work are to:

-discover the drivers of home value by exploring and visualizing the data.

-find correlations between different features and the target home values.

-use Recursive Feature Elimination to select the best features to use in my linear regression model.

-feed my train_scaled and test data sets through my linear regression model.

-evaluate my models using their R-squared values to see how they perform compared to a baseline created from the mean home value of all the homes in the data set.

-recommend the best features for use in predicting home values.

My deliverables are:

-a presentation and slide deck.

-a Jupyter Notebook report.

All files needed to recreate the work in this notebook are included in this repo.

Note: You will need your own env.py file to recreate work.
